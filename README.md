# Android Based OCR

Nowadays, almost everything is digital. Books, newspapers, articles â€“ name it. So what can be done to make a written or printed text digitized or even translated? Optical Character Recognition (OCR) comes with the solution. Itâ€™s capable of finding the text on the images and making it digital.
This android based OCR will allow user to snap or capture image using phone camera and then detect text in image.
It uses Firebase MLKit for text recognition.
